            <h2>Hello, World!</h2>
            <p>
              My name is Bennett Capozzi and I am a project manager at Via
              Transportation in New York City. I help cities launch innovative
              on-demand transportation solutions to support their existing
              services. I'm interested in tech, transportation, and making it
              easier and more efficient for people to get from point A to point
              B.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before I moved to New York and started at Via, I worked as a
              consultant for Booz Allen Hamilton in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. During
              my time in the Middle East I worked on a variety of projects in
              government affairs, tech, and international relations.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have a B.A. in History & Literature and a citation in Arabic
              from Harvard College where I focused on American History and
              Middle Eastern Studies.
